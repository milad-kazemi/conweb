    description = "2021 CPS-IoT Week Workshop: Verification of Autonomous & Robotic Systems ( VARS)
    
    Autonomous and Robotic Systems (ARS) are designed to interact with other ARS and/or humans,  in a changing environment;  they may be completely autonomous (e.g., SAE level 5 autonomous vehicles) or partially autonomous by providing aid to a human operator (e.g., surgical robots). ARS involve complicated designs that rely on the tight integration of complex hardware and software, including components that learn on-the-fly and can reconfigure themselves. This entails that the verification of ARS brings both research opportunities and challenges.

The aim of this workshop is to gather researchers from the verification, planning, robotics and cyber-physical systems communities in order to present and discuss their results, work in progress, challenges on the verification of autonomous and robotic systems. The scope of the workshop includes, but is not restricted to, the following topics:

•  verification for Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning techniques

•  specification, synthesis and verification of robust ARS

•  verification of automated planning

•  machine learning approaches to ARS verification

•  verification for robotics

•  inductive and SMT-based techniques in ARS verification

•  verification of learning

•  modelling of ARS-human interaction

•  online monitoring for ARS

•  verification for specific domains of autonomy (e.g., automotive)
